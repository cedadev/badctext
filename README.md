Tools for creating and manipulating badc text files (csv files with metadata)

This code (with example files) has been provided by BADC to aid the community to create and manipulate badc text files.

BADC text files are simply traditional comma separated value text files for data, which begin with a metadata block.

The unit tests within the code show examples of how to use the code.
